# Preprocessing-Data-Using-Pyspark

In this project, the task is to  clean the data containing information on last year's orders. They plan to use this cleaned data to build a demand forecasting model. The team has provided specific requirements for the desired output table format. An analyst has shared a parquet file named "orders_data.parquet" for you to clean and preprocess.
